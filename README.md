Hi, I’m brxxxl, aka @bruxxxel.

I’m interested in sports, skating, music, audio, acoustics, engineering, analog electronics and circuits in general.

Currently finishing an Electronics Technician program on IFSC and starting an Acoustic Engineer graduation course on UFSM, both in Brazil.

I’m looking to collaborate on music, audio, acoustic projects, sound design, digital art, architecture, sports statistics algorithms, finances and creative projects in general.

You can find me on my Instagram account, bru.x.el, as well as on my twitter profile, @brxxxl. For professional messages, contact me on lbruxxxel@gmail.com.
